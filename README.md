# Online Purchase Intention During Crises - Data Science Project

## 📚 Project Overview

This project explores the **factors influencing consumers' online purchase intentions during crises** in **Sri Lanka**, using survey data collected from various demographics.

The goal is to:

- Clean and preprocess the survey dataset
- Assess reliability and validity of constructs (using Cronbach’s Alpha and Inter-Item Correlation)
- Create composite variables (e.g., Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness)
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict purchase intentions
- Interpret the behavioral and cognitive factors influencing online purchasing during crises.
